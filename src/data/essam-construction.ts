    challenge: 'Essam was a highly experienced Construction Director but was struggling to break into the elite circle of "Giga-Projects" in Saudi Arabia (NEOM, Red Sea). His applications to major international PMCs were getting lost in the "Black Hole" of ATS systems, despite his strong track record. He needed a way to bypass the gatekeepers and speak directly to decision-makers.',
    strategy: [
        '**Executive Rebranding**: Completely overhauled his narrative from "Technical Manager" to "Strategic Project Director", emphasizing high-level stakeholder management and mega-project delivery.',
        '**Precision Targeting**: Identified and mapped out the specific Program Directors and VPs handling hiring for major KSA projects at firms like Hill International, Assystem, and GHD.',
        '**Direct Value Proposition**: Crafted a "Direct Outreach" campaign that pitched his expertise as an immediate solution to common project bottlenecks, rather than just asking for a job.'
    ],
    results: [
        '**Shattered the Silence**: Went from zero responses to active ongoing conversations with 10+ Senior Directors.',
        '**Multiple High-Value Opportunities**: Secured interview processes with industry giants including Hill International, Assystem, BOSS, and GHD.',
        '**Geographic Expansion**: Successfully generated demand for his profile across Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt simultaneously.'
    ],
    testimonial: "The approach was radically different. Instead of begging for a chance, I was discussing strategy with peers. The level of respect and interest I got was immediate.",
