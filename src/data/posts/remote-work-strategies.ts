    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Remote work is here to stay. But the rules of the game have changed. In an office, you get "credit" just for showing up. Your boss sees you at your desk at 6 PM and thinks "Wow, dedicated."
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      In a remote world, presence is invisible. You can work 12 hours a day, but if you don't communicate it correctly, you are a ghost.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      The biggest risk for remote workers isn't productivity; it's <strong>Career Stagnation</strong>. The "Proximity Bias" is real—bosses tend to promote the people they see. To fight this, you need a strategy for "Artificial Visibility."

    <p class="mb-4">
      When you live at work, you never leave work. Burnout rates are higher for remote employees.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>The Fake Commute:</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-6">
       Start your day with a walk. End your day with a walk. You need a physical signal to your brain that "Work is Over."
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Notification Hygiene:</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-6">
       Turn off Slack on your phone. If it is truly an emergency, they will call you. If you reply to Slack messages at 9 PM, you train people to expect replies at 9 PM.

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">1. How do I ask for a raise remotely?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">The same way as in person. Schedule a video call. Prepare a slide deck of your wins (use your EOD emails!). Share your screen. Do NOT do it over Slack or Email. You need to see their face.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">2. My boss monitors my mouse movement. Is this normal?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">It is common in some industries (Call Centers), but it is a sign of a toxic, low-trust culture ("Bossware"). If you are a senior professional, this is a red flag. Start looking for a results-oriented company.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">3. How do I bond with the team?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Schedule "Virtual Coffees" (15 mins, no work talk). Join the "fun" Slack channels (#pets, #cooking). Be human. Turn your camera ON. Hiding behind a black screen makes you a robot.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">4. Can I work from anywhere?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Check with HR (Tax implications are real). Don't just fly to Bali without asking. You could create a massive tax headache for your company (Nexus laws).</p>
