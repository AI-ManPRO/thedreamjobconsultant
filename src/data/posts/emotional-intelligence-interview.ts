      <h3 class="text-yellow-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The "Airport Test"</h3>
      <p class="text-yellow-800 mb-0">
        After the interview, the hiring team huddles. They don't ask " Can he code?" (They assume yes). They ask: "If I were stuck in an airport with him for 4 hours during a delay, would I want to kill myself?" If the answer is yes, you are out.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      The biggest lie in hiring is that we hire the "best" candidate.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      No. We hire the <strong>least risky</strong> candidate who we <strong>enjoy being around</strong>. Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the signal that says "I am safe, I am self-aware, and I am easy to work with."
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. Mirroring And Matching (The Science of Rapport)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      People like people who are like them. This is evolutionary biology.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">How to Calibrate:</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Energy Match:</strong> If they speak slowly and quietly (Analytical type), do not come in with loud, fast sales energy. You will overwhelm them. Slow down. If they are high energy, perk up.</li>
            <li><strong>Vocabulary Match:</strong> Listen to their words. Do they say "clients" or "customers"? "Revenue" or "Bookings"? "Challenges" or "Problems"? Use <em>their</em> words back to them. It subliminally signals membership in their tribe.</li>
            <li><strong>Posture Match:</strong> If they lean forward, lean forward. If they sit back, sit back. (Don't be a clown about it, keep it subtle).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Active Listening (Stop Rehearsing)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Most candidates are not listening; they are waiting for their turn to speak. They are mentally rehearsing their next STAR story while the interviewer is talking.
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">The "Loop Back" Technique</h4>
        <p class="text-slate-600">Prove you were listening by referencing something they said 10 minutes ago.</p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 italic mt-2">"You mentioned earlier that the team is struggling with cross-functional alignment. That reminds me of a situation at..."</p>
        <p class="text-sm mt-2 font-bold text-indigo-800">This builds massive credibility. It shows you care about THEIR problems, not just your script.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Reading the Room (Virtual vs. In-Person)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Zoom EQ</strong> is harder than in-person EQ. You lose 90% of body language cues.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3 mb-8">
        <li><strong>The "Nod":</strong> On Zoom, silence is terrifying. You must physically nod and smile more to show you are engaged.</li>
        <li><strong>Eye Contact:</strong> Look at the CAMERA, not the screen. This feels weird, but to them, it looks like eye contact.</li>
        <li><strong>Checking the Clock:</strong> If they look distracted (typing, looking away), stop talking. Ask: "I want to be respectful of time—should I go deeper on this or move to the next topic?" This shows high social awareness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Vulnerability (The Power Move)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Robots are perfect. Humans have flaws.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you present yourself as perfect, you seem arrogant or fake. Admitting a small weakness (strategically) makes you relatable.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-white p-4 rounded border border-slate-200 text-slate-600 mb-8">
        "Honestly, looking back at that project, I probably pushed the team too hard in the first week. I miscalculated the burnout risk. I learned to pace it better in Phase 2."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        This is disarming. It shows confidence. Only confident people admit mistakes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. Labeling Emotions (The Chris Voss Method)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
        If you sense tension, label it.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <em>"It sounds like you're worried that the new VP might change the roadmap."</em>
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <em>"It seems like urgency is the most important factor for this hire."</em>
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        When you label their emotion, they feel "heard." Their cortisol goes down, and their trust in you goes up.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">6. Case Study: The "Qualified but Jerk" Candidate</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Candidate:</strong> "Michael," a Senior Engineer.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Interview:</strong> He crushed the coding test. But when the interviewer pointed out a potential edge case, Michael argued and proved the interviewer wrong.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Result:</strong> Rejected. Feedback: "Brilliant, but abrasive. Would destroy team morale."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Better Approach:</strong> "That's a great catch. I hadn't considered that edge case. How do you usually handle that here?" (Collaborative > Combative).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Job hunting is dating. Logic gets you the first date (interview), but emotion gets you the marriage (offer). Don't just prepare your stats; prepare your vibes.
    </p>
