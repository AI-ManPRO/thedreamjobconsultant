    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Imagine walking into a networking event with a megaphone, announcing your expertise, and having hundreds of relevant people stop and listen. That is the power of posting on LinkedIn.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Yet, less than 1% of LinkedIn users post content weekly. The vast majority are passive consumers. By shifting from consumer to creator, you immediately differentiate yourself from 99% of the candidate pool.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      You don't need to be an "influencer." You don't need to take selfies. You don't need to go viral. You just need to be consistently visible to the right people. Content acts as a magnet for "Inbound Opportunities"—where recruiters come to <em>you</em>.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. Overcoming the "Cringe" Factor</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      "I don't have anything to say." "It feels boastful." "What if my boss sees it?"
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
      These are valid fears. The solution is to shift your mindset from "Self-Promotion" to "Value Addition." You aren't bragging; you are teaching, sharing, and curating.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Formatting for the "Scroll" (Algorithm Hacks)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      You are writing for mobile. People scan. Giant blocks of text get skipped. If your post looks like a wall of text, the user will scroll past it in 0.3 seconds.

    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-slate-800">
            <li><strong>The Hook:</strong> Your first sentence determines if they click "See more." Make it punchy. <br><em>Bad:</em> "I am writing this post to talk about..." <br><em>Good:</em> "Everything you know about SEO is wrong."</li>
            <li><strong>White Space:</strong> Use one-line paragraphs. It looks easier to read.</li>
            <li><strong>No External Links:</strong> LinkedIn hates when you link to YouTube or a Blog <em>in the post</em> (it takes people off their site). Put the link in the comments or your bio.</li>
            <li><strong>Engage Early:</strong> Reply to every comment within the first hour. This signals the algorithm that the post is "hot."</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. The "About" Section Masterclass</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Before you post content, fix your profile. Your "About" section is your sales page. Most people write it like a biography ("I was born in..."). It should be written like a Landing Page.

    <p class="mb-4">Speed is key. Use these tools to automate your workflow.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>AuthoredIn:</strong> Let's you preview how your post looks on Mobile/Desktop before you hit publish. Formatting is everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Taplio:</strong> AI tool that helps you find viral posts in your niche to get inspiration (not to copy, but to remix).</li>
        <li><strong>Canva:</strong> Create simple carousel PDFs. "5 Steps to X" in 5 slides works incredibly well on LinkedIn.</li>
        <li><strong>Grammarly:</strong> Typos destroy credibility. Never post without running a check.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">6. The 30-Day Visibility Challenge</h2>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">7. Strategies for Introverts</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If posting feels too heavy, start with commenting.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      <strong>The Strategy:</strong> Identify 10 "Influencers" or Leaders in your niche. Turn on the bell notification for their profiles. When they post, be one of the first to comment.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4 italic text-slate-600 bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
      <strong>The Value Comment:</strong> "Great point about [X]. I've also noticed that [Y] is becoming a factor. Do you think that will continue?"
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
      A top comment on a viral post can get 10,000 views. People see your insightful comment, click your profile, and see your resume. It is "hijacking" their reach legally. This is how many introverts build massive followings without ever posting a selfie.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">1. How often should I post?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Consistency > Frequency. Twice a week is plenty. Pick two days (e.g., Tuesday and Thursday) and stick to them. Don't post 5 times one week and zero the next.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">2. What if nobody likes my post?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">It happens. Delete it? No. Leave it. It shows you are trying. Also, "lurkers" see it even if they don't like it. Monitor your "impressions," not just likes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">3. Should I accept connection requests from strangers?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">If they are in your industry or a recruiter? Yes. If they are selling crypto or have no photo? No. A larger network increases your "2nd degree" reach.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">4. Can I use AI to write my posts?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Use it for ideas ("Give me 10 content ideas for a Project Manager"), but write the post yourself. AI sounds robotic and lacks the "human" element that drives engagement.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">5. Is Saturday/Sunday good for posting?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Surprisingly, yes. Engagement is lower, but competition is MUCH lower. A personal story posted on Saturday morning often performs very well.</p>
