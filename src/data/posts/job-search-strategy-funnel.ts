      <p class="text-indigo-800 mb-0">
        Applying to 50 jobs a day on "Easy Apply" and getting 0 replies is not a strategy; it is spam. If your strategy isn't working after 2 weeks, don't do it <em>harder</em>. Change the strategy.

      Salespeople have a quota. You have a quota (1 Job Offer). Salespeople use a CRM. You should too.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. Top of Funnel: Prospecting (Sourcing)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Goal:</strong> Identify 50 Target Companies.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Don't look for open jobs. Look for companies you want to work for.
      <br>- <strong>Tier 1 (Dream):</strong> Google, Stripe, Airbnb.
      <br>- <strong>Tier 2 (Realistic):</strong> Mid-stage Series B/C startups.
      <br>- <strong>Tier 3 (Safety):</strong> Local firms, smaller agencies.
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold text-navy-900">
        Action: Create an Excel sheet / Notion DB. List the companies. Set up alerts for them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Middle of Funnel: Outreach (Application)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Goal:</strong> Get a Meeting (Interview).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Metric:</strong> Application-to-Interview Rate.
      <br>Industry Average: 2% (Cold Apply).
      <br>Target: 20% (Networked Apply).

            <li><strong>Channel 1:</strong> Apply on the portal within 24 hours (Speed).</li>
            <li><strong>Channel 2:</strong> Find the Hiring Manager on LinkedIn. Connect with a note (Value).</li>
            <li><strong>Channel 3:</strong> Find a peer (someone in the role you want). Ask for a coffee chat (Intel).</li>

      <strong>Metric:</strong> Interview-to-Offer Rate.

      If you are getting interviews but no offers, your resume works but your <em>pitch</em> is broken.
      <br>- Are you failing the screen? (Communication issue).
      <br>- Are you failing the panel? (Technical/Case Study issue).

        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-green-900 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>8:00 AM:</strong> Scan "New in last 24h" alerts. Apply immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>9:00 AM:</strong> Send 5 tailored LinkedIn connection requests to Hiring Managers.</li>
            <li><strong>10:00 AM:</strong> Follow up on applications sent 5 days ago ("Just bumping this thread").</li>
            <li><strong>11:00 AM:</strong> Upskill / Coffee Chat.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4 italic text-sm text-green-800">
            Do not browse job boards after 12:00 PM. It is a waste of time. Focus on networking in the afternoon.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-800 mt-8 mb-4">Build Your Dashboard</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        You cannot improve what you do not measure.
        <br>Create a simple sheet:
        <br><strong>Week 1:</strong> 50 Apps -> 2 Interviews -> 0 Offers. (4% Rate).
        <br><strong>Week 2:</strong> 50 Apps -> 5 Interviews -> 1 Offer. (10% Rate - Improvement!).

        <h4 class="font-bold text-yellow-900 mb-2">The Sunday Audit</h4>
        <p class="text-yellow-800 mb-4">
            Every Sunday, look at your numbers.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-yellow-800 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Sent 50 apps, 0 interviews?</strong> Stop applying. Rewrite your resume. It is clearly not parsing.</li>
            <li><strong>Had 5 phone screens, 0 second rounds?</strong> Stop applying. Practice your "Tell me about yourself" answer. You are rambling.</li>
            <li><strong>Had 3 final rounds, 0 offers?</strong> You are close. Work on your closing/negotiation or "cultural fit" stories.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Treating your job search like a numbers game ("I'll just apply to more") leads to burnout. Treating it like a strategic sales funnel leads to optimized effort and, eventually, a signed contract.
