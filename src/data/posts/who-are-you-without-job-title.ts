      <h3 class="text-indigo-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The Empty Box</h3>
      <p class="text-indigo-800 mb-0">
        We spend 40-60 hours a week working. It is our primary social signal. When it is taken away, we feel like a ghost. We feel we have nothing to contribute to the tribe. This is an evolutionarily wired fear of being cast out.
      </p>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      "I am a Google Engineer" is a dangerous sentence. Because if Google fires you, you are nothing. "I am a Problem Solver who loves Code" is a safe sentence. No one can fire you from that.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The "Human Being" vs "Human Doing"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Western culture values Doing. "What did you produce today?"
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Shift:</strong> Value Being.
      <br>Are you a kind friend? Are you a curious reader? Are you a patient parent? These things have value, even if they don't have a paycheck attached.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Retraining the Brain</h2>
    
    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">The "24-Hour" Rule</h4>
        <p class="text-slate-600">
            For the next 24 hours, you are forbidden from talking about work or the job search.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 mt-2">
            When someone asks "What do you do?", answer with a passion.
            <br><em>"I'm really into urban gardening right now. I just planted some tomatoes. What about you?"</em>
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 mt-2">
            Watch their reaction. They will be relieved. People are tired of talking about work. You become the most interesting person in the room.
        </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. The Asset of "Perspective"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      When you get your next job (and you will), this period of unemployment will be your superpower.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3 mb-8">
        <li>You will have more empathy for others.</li>
        <li>You will not stress about small office politics (because you know what real stress is).</li>
        <li>You will save money more aggressively (because you know safety is an illusion).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-800 mt-8 mb-4">The "Funeral Test"</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Imagine your own funeral. Who is there? What are they saying?
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        No one talks about your Quarterly Business Review. They talk about how you made them feel.
        <br><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Invest in the things people will talk about at your funeral. Those are the only things that you truly own. Your job is just a rental.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Your tombstone will not say "Senior Marketing Manager." It will say "Beloved Father," "Generous Friend," "Adventurer." Start living for the eulogy virtues, not the resume virtues.
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-navy-900 text-white p-8 rounded-xl text-center mt-12 shadow-xl">
      <h3 class="text-gold-500 font-bold text-2xl mb-4">The Final Word</h3>
      <p class="mb-8 text-lg text-slate-300">Thank you for reading this series. If you have made it this far, you have the mindset of a champion. Go get what is yours.</p>
