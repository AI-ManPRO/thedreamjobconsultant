      <h3 class="text-yellow-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The Recruiter's Script</h3>
      <p class="text-yellow-800 mb-0">
        Recruiters are busy. They have 15 minutes. They have a checklist. They want to check boxes: [x] Can speak clearly, [x] In budget, [x] Understands the role. Your job is to help them check the boxes, not to tell your life story.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      The goal of the phone screen is not to get the job. The goal is to get the <em>next interview</em>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The Opener: "Tell Me About Yourself"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      This is not an invitation to talk about your childhood.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">The "Present-Past-Future" Formula</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Present:</strong> "Currently, I am a Marketing Manager at X, focusing on SEO."</li>
            <li><strong>Past:</strong> "Before that, I spent 4 years at Agency Y, where I learned paid media."</li>
            <li><strong>Future:</strong> "I'm looking to move in-house to a SaaS company like yours to build long-term growth."</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4 font-bold text-green-700">Time limit: 90 seconds max.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. The Trap: "What are your salary expectations?"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you give a number, you lose.
      <br>- Too high: Rejected.
      <br>- Too low: You left money on the table.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-slate-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-slate-400 italic">
        <strong>The Pivot:</strong> "I'm open to market rates, but right now I'm focused on finding the right fit. Could you share the budgeted range for this position?"
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        (Note: In California, NY, and WA, they are legally required to tell you).
    </p>

    <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-4">Other "Knockout" Questions to Avoid</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-red-800 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>"Why did you leave your last job?"</strong> (Never say: "My boss was toxic." Say: "I reached a ceiling and am looking for new challenges.")</li>
            <li><strong>"Do you have other offers?"</strong> (Always say: "I am in late stage conversations with a few companies." Creates scarcity.)</li>
            <li><strong>"Can you start immediately?"</strong> (Say: "I have a 2-week notice period to respect my current team." Shows loyalty.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. The Setup: "Why do you want to work here?"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Common bad answer: "I need a job."
      <br>Slightly better bad answer: "You are a great company."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Winning Answer:</strong> "I saw your recent Series B announcement and your plan to expand into Europe. My background is specifically in EU market entry, so I felt my skills could directly help you achieve that Q4 goal."
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold text-navy-900">
        Connect your skill to their news.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-800 mt-8 mb-4">The "Secret Weapon": The Name Drop</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        If you have networked (which you should), mention it here.
    </p>
    <p class="italic text-slate-600 bg-slate-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500">
        "I was actually chatting with [Name], one of your Product Managers, about the culture last week, and their description of the [Project Name] really excited me."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        This signals "Social Proof." You are already "in the tribe."
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. The Close: "Do you have any questions?"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Never say "No." It makes you look disinterested.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3 mb-8">
        <li>"Why is this position open now?" (New growth vs Backfill).</li>
        <li>"What is the timeline for the next steps?" (Shows eagerness).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Be high energy. Smile while you talk (it changes your voice tone). And treat the recruiter with respect. They hold the keys to the Hiring Manager's calendar.
    </p>
