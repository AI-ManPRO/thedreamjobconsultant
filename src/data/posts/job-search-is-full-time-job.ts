      <h3 class="text-indigo-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The Drift</h3>
      <p class="text-indigo-800 mb-0">
        Without a boss, most people drift. Meaningless tasks expand to fill the day. You check email 50 times. You tweak your resume font for 2 hours. By 5 PM, you are exhausted but have accomplished nothing. This is "Fake Work."
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      You are not "Unemployed." You are a "Consultant" looking for your next client. Act like one.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The Physical Setup (The Office)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Rule 1:</strong> Put on pants.
      <br>If you work in pajamas, your brain thinks it's rest time. Shower, dress, and sit at a desk.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Rule 2:</strong> Separation of Church and State.
      <br>Bedroom = Sleep. Living Room = Relax. Desk = Work. Do not apply for jobs from the couch.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. The 9-5 Schedule (The Timeblock)</h2>
    
    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">The High-Performer's Calendar</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>8:00 AM - 10:00 AM: Deep Work (Applications).</strong> Apply to new jobs posted overnight. Customize resumes. No email, no social media.</li>
            <li><strong>10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Outreach (Networking).</strong> Send connection requests. Follow up on emails. This requires emotional energy, so do it before lunch.</li>
            <li><strong>12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch & Walk.</strong> Leave the house. Get sunlight. Reset cortisol.</li>
            <li><strong>1:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Skill Building.</strong> Take a certification course. Build a portfolio project.</li>
            <li><strong>3:00 PM - 5:00 PM: Admin & Research.</strong> Research companies for tomorrow. Log your metrics.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      A CEO manages by metrics. You need metrics.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-green-900 mb-4">Your Weekly Targets:</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-green-800 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>New Applications:</strong> 15 (Quality > Quantity).</li>
            <li><strong>Networking Messages Sent:</strong> 25.</li>
            <li><strong>Coffee Chats Booked:</strong> 3.</li>
            <li><strong>Skills Learned:</strong> 1 new tool/concept.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-800 mt-8 mb-4">Visualize the Workflow (Kanban)</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Do not use your inbox as a To-Do list. Use Trello or Notion.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Create 5 Columns:</strong>
        <br>1. <strong>Backlog</strong> (Companies I like but haven't researched).
        <br>2. <strong>To Do</strong> (Researching today).
        <br>3. <strong>Applied</strong> (Waiting for reply).
        <br>4. <strong>Interviewing</strong> (Active conversations).
        <br>5. <strong>Dead</strong> (Rejected/Ghosted - Archive these weekly to keep the board clean).
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-600 italic">
        Moving a card from "To Do" to "Applied" gives you a dopamine hit. You need that hit to keep going.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. The "Clock Out" Ritual</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      The hardest part of unemployment is that you never feel "done."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> At 5:00 PM, close the laptop. Say out loud: "I have done enough today." Then stop. If you work at 9 PM, you will burn out by Thursday. You need recovery to be sharp for interviews.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Discipline is freedom. By structuring your day, you remove the guilt of "not doing enough" and replace it with the confidence of "executing a plan."
    </p>
