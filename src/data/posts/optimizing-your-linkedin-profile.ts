      <h3 class="text-indigo-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The "Recruiter License" Secret</h3>
      <p class="text-indigo-800 mb-0">
        Recruiters pay $10k/year for "LinkedIn Recruiter." This tool lets them search for candidates like you search for shoes on Amazon. If you don't have the right keywords in the right places, you simply do not exist in their search results.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Your LinkedIn profile is not an online resume. It is a 24/7 Networking Event where you are always presenting.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The Headline: Your Billboard (SEO Gold)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Most people just put their job title: "Marketing Manager at Company X."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Why this fails:</strong> It tells me <em>what</em> you are (a commodity), but not <em>how good</em> you are (a luxury). More importantly, it wastes the most valuable SEO real estate on the internet.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Top 5 Keywords for Your Industry</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Go to LinkedIn Jobs. Search for your target role. Read 10 Job Descriptions. What words appear in EVERY job ad?
        <br>- If you are in sales: "Prospecting," "Closing," "Salesforce."
        <br>- If you are in Project Mgmt: "Agile," "Scrum," "Stakeholder Management."
        <br><strong>Put these exact words in your headline.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. The Banner (Background Photo)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you have the default grey geometric background, you look like a bot or an amateur.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Upload a banner that represents your industry.
      <br>- Developer: Code on a screen.
      <br>- Architect: Blueprints or a skyline.
      <br>- Speaker: A photo of you on stage.
      <br>This is free "Visual Credibility."

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. The "About" Section: Hook 'Em</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Do not write in the third person ("John is an experienced leader..."). It sounds pretentious. Write in the first person ("I am...").
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Only the first 3 lines are visible before the "See More" click. Make them count.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Experience: Optimize for Skimming</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      This should mirror your resume, but you can add media!
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The "Featured" Hack:</strong> LinkedIn allows you to attach links/PDFs to job entries. Attach your portfolio, a press release about a project launch, or a video of a talk you gave. Visual proof converts higher than text.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. Social Proof: Recommendations</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      A profile with 0 recommendations looks suspicious.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Trading Strategy:</strong> Message 3 favorite ex-colleagues today.
      <br>"Hey [Name], hope you're well. I'm updating my profile—would you be open to writing a brief recommendation about our time working on Project X? I'd be happy to write one for you in return!"
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Get at least 3 recent ones. It functions like Amazon Reviews for your career.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">6. Activity: Are You Alive?</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If a recruiter visits your profile and sees your last activity was "Liked a post 8 months ago," they assume you are dormant.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Engage. Comment on 3 industry posts a week. Insightful comments ("Great point about X, but have you considered Y?") often get more views than the post itself.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      A great resume might get you applied. A great LinkedIn profile allows you to get <em>found</em>. The best job offers come when you aren't even looking, because a recruiter found you via search.
    </p>
