      <h3 class="text-red-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The "Soft Layoff"</h3>
      <p class="text-red-800 mb-0">
        Let's be honest. Many RTO mandates are "Soft Layoffs." Companies know that 20% of people will quit rather than return, saving them the cost of severance. If you refuse to return without a strategy, you are playing right into their hands.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      You cannot say "I want to work from home because I like walking my dog." That is a "Me" problem.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      You must say "I work from home because my output is higher." That is a "Business" solution.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The Leverage Audit</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Before you fight the mandate, check your ammo.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">Are you indispensable?</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>The "Bus Factor":</strong> If you got hit by a bus, would a critical project fail? If yes, you have leverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Recruitability:</strong> How hard is it to replace you? If you are a Generic Accountant, leverage is low. If you are a COBOL expert, leverage is high.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Review:</strong> Did you just get a "Top Performer" rating? Use it. "As my recent review shows, my remote output is top-tier."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. The Negotiation Script: "The Anchor"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Don't ask for "Full Remote" immediately if the mandate is 3 days. Anchor high, then compromise.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded border-l-4 border-slate-400 text-slate-600 font-mono text-sm mb-6">
        "I understand the push for collaboration. However, my role involves [Deep Work Task] which requires 4-hour blocks of uninterrupted focus. <br><br>
        In the office, the noise levels reduce my output by ~30%. <br><br>
        <strong>Proposal:</strong> I come in 1 day/week for the All-Hands and Sprint Planning (Collaboration), and work remotely 4 days for execution (Deep Work). We trial this for 30 days. If my output drops, I return to the standard schedule."

    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. The "Remote Accommodation" (HR Route)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If your manager says "My hands are tied," you might have a Medical or relocation angle.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3 mb-8">
        <li><strong>Relocation:</strong> "I was hired as a 'Remote' employee in my contract. Moving to HQ would require a relocation package ($50k). Is the company prepared to offer that?" (Often, they aren't).</li>
        <li><strong>Disability/Neurodiversity:</strong> If you have ADHD or anxiety that is exacerbated by open offices, you can request a formal accommodation under the ADA (in the US). Consult a lawyer first.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. If You Must Return: Negotiate the "Tax"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you lose the battle, negotiate the war. Commuting costs money and time.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      "Returning to the office adds 10 hours of commute time and $500/month in travel/food costs. This is effectively a pay cut. I'd like to discuss a salary adjustment to market rate to reflect this change in working conditions."
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. The "Walking Papers"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If they say "Return or Resign," do NOT resign.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Make them fire you.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      "I am available to work and eager to contribute. I cannot, however, commute to the office due to [Reason]. I will continue to log in remotely and deliver my tasks."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      This puts the ball in their court. If they fire you, you likely qualify for unemployment (depending on state). If you resign, you get nothing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The "Office" is a tool, not a religion. Smart companies use it for social bonding, not email checking. If your company treats RTO as a compliance checkbox, it might be time to find a "Remote-First" employer.
