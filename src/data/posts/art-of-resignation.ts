      <p class="text-red-800 mb-0">
        You are angry. You are leaving because of a toxic boss or a low salary. You want to "tell them the truth" in your exit interview. <strong>Do not do this.</strong> The tech world is small. The person you trash today will be the hiring manager at your dream company in 5 years.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Resignation is a business transaction. It should be devoid of emotion.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Your goal is not to "vent." Your goal is to protect your reputation and your network. The "Peak-End Rule" of psychology states that people judge an experience largely based on how it felt at its peak and at its end. If you have a messy exit, 5 years of great work will be erased from their memory.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The "2-Minute Warning" Rule</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Never blindside your boss with an official HR letter. It is disrespectful.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">The Order of Operations:</h4>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Sign the Offer:</strong> Do not say a word until the written offer is signed and the background check clears. Many offers are contingent.</li>
            <li><strong>Schedule the Meeting:</strong> Put a 15-minute "Quick Check-in" or "Updates" meeting on your manager's calendar. Do not do this on a Friday afternoon (it ruins their weekend) or Monday morning (it ruins their week). Tuesday or Wednesday is best.</li>
            <li><strong>The Verbal Notice:</strong> Deliver the news verbally first.</li>
            <li><strong>The Paper Trail:</strong> Send the formal email immediately after the meeting solidifies the timeline.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. The Script (What to Say)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Keep it short. "Gratitude -> News -> Transition Plan."
    </p>

    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">The Verbal Script</h4>
        <p class="font-mono text-sm text-slate-600 bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded mb-4">
            "I have some tough news. I've decided to move on to a new opportunity. <br><br>
            I want you to know this wasn't an easy decision. I've truly valued your mentorship and the time I've had here. But this new role offers a specific challenge [Director level / New Industry] that I feel compelled to take.<br><br>
            My priority now is ensuring a seamless handover so the team doesn't miss a beat. I've already drafted a transition plan."
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm italic text-slate-500">Notice: No complaints. No "I'm leaving because you pay poorly." It is all forward-looking.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. The Counter-Offer Trap</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you are good, they will panic. They will offer you more money to stay.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <strong class="text-yellow-800 block mb-2">Why you must Say NO:</strong>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-700 mb-2">Statistics show that <strong>80% of people who accept a counter-offer leave within 6 months anyway.</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Trust is Broken:</strong> You are now a "flight risk." They will not promote you.</li>
            <li><strong>The Problem Remains:</strong> Money doesn't fix a toxic culture or a bad boss.</li>
            <li><strong>They are Buying Time:</strong> They are paying you to stay just long enough to find your replacement.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>How to decline:</strong> "I’m incredibly flattered, and I appreciate that you value my work. But for me, this move isn’t about salary—it’s about the new strategic direction/role. So I’m going to stick with my decision."
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. The "Garden Leave" Negotiation</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      For senior roles (VP/Director), especially in Sales or Finance, you might have access to sensitive data.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you are going to a competitor, the company might want to walk you out the door immediately to prevent data theft. This is called "Garden Leave." You stay on payroll for 2 weeks (or more), but you are banned from the office/systems.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        <strong>The Play:</strong> If you want Garden Leave (a paid vacation!), mention clearly in your resignation that you are going to a "direct competitor in the [Space]." This forces their hand to shut off your access. Enjoy your vacation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. The Exit Interview Trap</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      HR will schedule an "Exit Interview." They will say, "We want your honest feedback to improve the culture."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      <strong>This is a trap.</strong> HR works for the company, not you. Negative feedback in an exit interview rarely leads to change; it just marks you as "disgruntled."
    </p>

    <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">How to handle it:</h4>
        <p class="text-slate-700"><strong>HR:</strong> "Why are you really leaving? Is it because of [Manager]?"</p>
        <p class="text-slate-700"><strong>You:</strong> "As I said, I love the team, but this new opportunity was just too good a fit for my long-term career goals to pass up. I have nothing but good things to say about my time here."</p>
        <p class="text-indigo-800 font-bold mt-2">Be boring. Be pleasant. Be gone.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">6. Check Your Non-Compete</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Before you resign, read your employment contract.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3 mb-8">
        <li><strong>Non-Compete:</strong> Can you work for a competitor? (FTC banned most of these in the US, but check your local laws).</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Solicit:</strong> You usually cannot poach your team or clients for 12 months. Be very careful here. If you recruit your old team, you can be sued.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Assignment:</strong> Anything you created on company time/laptops belongs to them. <strong>Clear your personal files from your laptop BEFORE you resign.</strong> Once you resign, IT might lock your laptop remotely within minutes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">7. The "Boomerang" Effect</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Data shows that 15% of employees return to a former employer ("Boomerang Employees"). Usually at a higher title and salary.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      By leaving gracefully, you keep that door open. You become an "Alumni," not a "Traitor." Add your boss and colleagues on LinkedIn immediately. Send a final "Goodbye" email to the whole team (BCC them) with your personal email/LinkedIn included.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The peak-end rule states that people remember an experience based on how it ended. You can be a star performer for 5 years, but if you act childishly in your last 2 weeks, that is what they will remember. Finish strong.
