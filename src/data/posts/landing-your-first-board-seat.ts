      <p class="text-indigo-800 mb-0">
        You think you are "too busy" for a Board seat? The busiest CEOs sit on 2-3 boards. Why? Because it makes them better regular CEOs. It is the only way to see how other companies solve the problems you are facing.

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Operations is a young person's game. Governance is forever.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      If you want a career that lasts into your 70s, you need to transition from "Doing" (Management) to "Overseeing" (Governance). But the skill set is completely different. If you walk into a Board interview and talk about how good you are at operations, you will fail.

            Hi [Name],<br><br>
            I've been following [PE Firm]'s recent acquisition of [Company]. Given the roll-up strategy, I assume you are looking for governance support around Supply Chain integration.<br><br>
            I am currently the COO of [Company], where I led 4 post-merger integrations. I am looking to join a board where I can leverage this M&A playbook to support management.<br><br>
            I am not looking for an operating role—strictly governance/advisory. Attached is my Board Bio.<br><br>
            Best,<br>
            [Your Name]

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. The Interview Questions</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      They won't ask "Tell me about a time you failed." They will ask:
    </p>

    <ul class="space-y-4 mb-8">
        <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-gold-600 font-bold mr-2">Q1:</span>
            <p class="text-slate-600"><strong>"How would you handle a CEO who is hitting numbers but destroying the culture?"</strong> (Testing your ethics vs. greed balance).</p>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-gold-600 font-bold mr-2">Q2:</span>
            <p class="text-slate-600"><strong>"Describe a time you dissented in the boardroom but supported the final decision."</strong> (Testing "Disagree and Commit").</p>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-gold-600 font-bold mr-2">Q3:</span>
            <p class="text-slate-600"><strong>"What is your view on our debt structure?"</strong> (Testing financial literacy).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">6. Case Study: The "Specialist"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Candidate:</strong> "Maria," a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> She wanted a board seat but was told she was "too operational."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Pivot:</strong> We rebranded her not as a CISO, but as a "Risk & Governance Expert." With new SEC rules requiring cybersecurity expertise on public boards, she became a hot commodity.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Result:</strong> She targeted regional banks (who are terrified of hacks). She didn't apply; she networked with the Audit Committee Chairs. She landed 2 board seats in 18 months, adding $150k to her annual income.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      A Board seat is not a retirement gift. It is a job. It requires study, networking, and a completely different resume. But it is the only job where you can work 100 hours a year and make six figures, all while protecting your long-term career relevancy.
