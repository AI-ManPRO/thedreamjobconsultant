      <h3 class="text-blue-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The Rejection Loop</h3>
      <p class="text-blue-800 mb-0">
        Rejection triggers the same areas in the brain as physical pain. A job search is essentially walking into a room and asking "Do you like me?" and hearing "No" over and over. It is grueling. Acknowledging the pain is the first step to managing it.

      You are not weak for feeling sad. You are human. But you cannot let the sadness paralyze you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The "Valley of Despair"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Every job search follows a curve:
      <br><strong>Phase 1: Optimism.</strong> "I'll find something better!"
      <br><strong>Phase 2: Pessimism.</strong> "Why is nobody callling back?"
      <br><strong>Phase 3: Despair.</strong> "I am unhireable. I will lose my house."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Strategy:</strong> recognize where you are on the map. If you are in Phase 3, stop applying. You are radiating desperation. Take 3 days off. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Detach Activity from Outcome</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      You can control the <em>Input</em> (Sending the resume). You cannot control the <em>Output</em> (Getting the interview).
    </p>
    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">The Stoic Approach</h4>
        <p class="text-slate-600">
            Celebrate the input.
            <br>Did you send 5 emails today? <strong>Success.</strong>
            <br>Did you get rejected? <strong>Irrelevant.</strong>
            <br>Reward yourself for doing the work, not for the result.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Build an "Identity Shield"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If your entire identity is "Accountant," then losing your job means losing yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Diversify your identity assets.</strong>
      <br>- You are a Father/Mother.
      <br>- You are a Runner.
      <br>- You are a Gamer.
      <br>- You are a Volunteer.
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-8">
        Invest time in these other identities. When the "Career" pillar cracks, the "Life" pillars must hold the roof up.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Toxic Positivity vs. Real Hope</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      "Everything happens for a reason!"
      <br>Shut up. Sometimes bad things just happen.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Real Hope</strong> is not pretending everything is fine. Real Hope is looking at the wreckage and saying: "It sucks, but I have a plan to rebuild it."
    </p>
    <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-green-900 mb-2">The Gratitude Journal</h4>
        <p class="text-green-800">
            It's cliché because it works. Write down 3 things that went well today. "The coffee was good." "The sun was out." "My friend texted me." It forces your brain to scan for safety, reducing anxiety.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Dopamine Detox</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Unemployed brains crave cheap dopamine. You scroll TikTok for 4 hours. You eat junk food.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Trap:</strong> This spikes your dopamine momentarily, then crashes it below baseline, making you more depressed.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Rule:</strong> No social media before 12:00 PM. Earn your dopamine through small wins (sending an email, going for a run).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      This is a marathon through mud. If you break your leg (mental breakdown), you can't finish the race. Prioritize your sanity over your salary. The job will come. Ensure you are still whole when it does.
    </p>
