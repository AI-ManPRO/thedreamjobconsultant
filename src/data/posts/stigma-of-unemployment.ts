      <h3 class="text-red-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The "Damaged Goods" Myth</h3>
      <p class="text-red-800 mb-0">
        You fear that recruiters see your gap and think: "Why does nobody want him? What is wrong with him?"
        <br><strong>Reality Check:</strong> In 2026, layoffs are normal. Google laid off 12,000 people. Are they all "damaged goods"? No. They are victims of bad math, not bad performance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Shame smells. If you walk into an interview apologizing for your existence, they will smell it. Confidence is the only deodorant.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. Own the Narrative (The Spin)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Don't hide the gap. Frame it.
    </p>
    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
        <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <p class="font-bold text-red-700 mb-2">Weak Frame</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">"Yeah, I got laid off in January and I've just been looking since then. It's been really tough." (Victim).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <p class="font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">Strong Frame</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">"My role was impacted by the restructuring in January. I decided to take a deliberate sabbatical to upskill in AI and recharge. Now I'm fully refreshed and ready to attack this new role." (Hero).</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Fills the Gap with "Active Rest"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If a car is parked in a garage for 6 months, the battery dies. Recruiters worry your battery is dead.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Show them the engine is running.</strong>
      <br>- "I've been consulting for a few small startups."
      <br>- "I trained for a marathon."
      <br>- "I wrote a blog about industry trends."
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold text-navy-900">
        It doesn't matter <em>what</em> you did. It matters that you did <em>something</em>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. The Social Isolation Trap</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Shame makes you hide. You stop going to dinner parties because you dread the question: "What do you do?"
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> Change the answer.
      <br>Don't say: "I'm unemployed."
      <br>Say: "I'm transitioning between roles in the Tech sector. Actually, do you know anyone at [Target Company]?"
    </p>
    <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-yellow-900 mb-2">People Want to Help</h4>
        <p class="text-yellow-800">
            Most people have been unemployed at some point. They don't judge you; they empathize with you. But they can't help you if you are hiding in your basement.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-800 mt-8 mb-4">Dealing with Financial Panic ("Runway Anxiety")</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Shame is often compounded by fear of bankruptcy.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Action:</strong> Calculate your "Death Date."
        <br>Bank Account / Monthly Burn = Months of Runway.
        <br>Knowing you have exactly 5.5 months is scary, but it is better than the vague "I'm running out of money" feeling. It turns a Ghost into a Math Problem.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-600">
        If you have >6 months, breathe. You have time.
        <br>If you have <2 months, get a "Survival Job" (Uber, Barista). It extends your runway and kills the panic. There is zero shame in honest work.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Your employment status describes your current cash flow, not your character. Separate the two. You are a valuable asset currently on the open market. That is a position of power, not weakness.
    </p>
