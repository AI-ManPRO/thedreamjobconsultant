      Once you reach the Director or VP level, the rules of the job search change. You are no longer being hired just for your skills (can you code? can you sell?); you are being hired for your <strong>Philosophy</strong> and your <strong>Story</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      A Resume is a retrospective document. It looks backward at what you did. An Executive Bio is a prospective document. It looks forward at who you are and how you lead.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      If you are applying for C-Suite roles with only a resume, you are bringing a knife to a gunfight. You need a Bio.

            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">Paragraph 1: The Anchor (The Hook)</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-700"><strong>Goal:</strong> Define your brand in one sentence. <br> "Jane Smith is a Chief Revenue Officer who builds $100M sales engines for Series B startups. With a background in both Engineering and Sales, she bridges the gap between product innovation and market reality."</p>

            <p class="text-slate-700"><strong>Goal:</strong> Validate your seniority with numbers. <br> "Currently serving as VP of Sales at TechCorp, Jane led the company's expansion into APAC, growing revenue from $10M to $50M in 18 months.

            <p class="text-slate-700"><strong>Goal:</strong> Explain HOW you lead. <br> "Jane believes that 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast.' She is known for building high-retention cultures where reps are trained as consultants, not just closers. She created the 'TechCorp Academy,' a training program that reduced ramp time by 40%."</p>

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
         <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
             <h4 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-2">Use Resume When:</h4>
             <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-red-800 space-y-2">
                 <li>Applying through an online portal (ATS).</li>
                 <li>Meeting with HR/Talent Acquisition.</li>
                 <li>The job description specifically asks for it.</li>
                 <li>Detailed work history verification is needed.</li>
             </ul>

         <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
             <h4 class="font-bold text-green-900 mb-2">Use Bio When:</h4>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Different Flavors of Bios</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">One size does not fit all. You might need two versions.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>The "Board Bio":</strong> Focuses on governance, fiscal responsibility, and industry connections. Less about "doing work" and more about "oversight."</li>
        <li><strong>The "Speaker Bio":</strong> Short (100 words), punchy, focuses on authority and credibility ("Jane is the world's leading expert on..."). Designed to be read by a host introducing you on stage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">1. Should I include a photo?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">On a Bio? <strong>Yes.</strong> It is a marketing document. A high-quality professional headshot in the top corner makes it personal. (Note: Never put a photo on a Resume in the US/UK).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">2. First Person or Third Person?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Traditionally, Bios are <strong>Third Person</strong> ("Jane is..."). This makes it easy for others to copy-paste it for event intros. However, for a LinkedIn "About" section, convert it to <strong>First Person</strong> ("I am...").</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">3. Can I highlight early career work?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Yes! This is the beauty of the bio. You can weave a narrative thread from your first job to your current one, even if they seem unrelated. "Jane's early days as a teacher gave her the patience that now defines her leadership style as a CEO."</p>
