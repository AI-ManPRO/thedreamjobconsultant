      "So, what have you been doing for the last 8 months?"
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The question makes your palms sweat. You feel the need to over-explain. "Well, I was laid off, and then my mom got sick, and the market is bad..."
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Stop. In 2026, gaps are normal. Layoffs are common. Burnout is recognized. The suspicion around gaps has faded, <em>if</em> you frame it correctly. Confidence is the difference between a "Gap" and a "Sabbatical."

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The "Consulting" Patch (The Magic Fix)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you are worried about a 6-month hole on your resume, fill it.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      You don't need a full-time job to be "working." Did you help a friend with their website? Did you advise a former colleague? Did you take a course?
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <strong class="text-navy-900 block mb-2">How to list it on LinkedIn:</strong>
        <p class="text-slate-800 font-bold">Independent Consultant | Self-Employed</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-2">Jan 2025 - Present</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Provided strategic advisory services to early-stage SaaS startups.</li>
            <li>Conducted market research for...</li>
            <li>Upskilled in React and Node.js.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500">Why this works: It shows you remained <em>active</em>. It removes the "gap" visually. Even if it was unpaid work, it is still experience.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Three Scripts for the Interview</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      When asked, keep it short. 10% explanation, 90% "Ready to work."
    </p>

    <div class="space-y-6 mb-8">
        <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">Scenario A: The Layoff</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-700 italic">"My role was impacted by the company-wide restructuring at [Company] last year, along with 20% of the workforce. I took the opportunity to take a deliberate pause to [learn Skill X / reflect on career], and now I'm fully recharged and targeted on [this specific type of role]."</p>
        </div>
         <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">Scenario B: Caregiving / Health</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-700 italic">"I took some planned time off to manage a family matter, which has now been fully resolved. During that time, I stayed current by [reading Industry News / taking a course], and I'm eager to get back into a full-time Operating role."</p>
            <p class="text-xs text-red-500 mt-2">Note: You do not need to give medical details. "Family matter" is sufficient.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">Scenario C: The "Sabbatical" (Travel/Burnout)</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-700 italic">"After 10 years of non-stop execution, I decided to take a 6-month sabbatical to travel and recharge. It was the best decision I ever made. I'm coming back with renewed energy and a fresh perspective, ready to tackle the next 5 years."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. LinkedIn's "Career Break" Feature</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      LinkedIn now allows you to officially list a "Career Break" in your experience section.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Options include: "Bereavement," "Caregiving," "Gap Year," "Layoff," "Professional Development."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      <strong>Should you use it?</strong> <br>
      <strong>YES</strong> if the gap is > 6 months. It looks cleaner than a blank space. <br>
      <strong>NO</strong> if the gap is < 3 months. Nobody notices a 3-month gap.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Formatting Tricks (Resume)</h2>
    
    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
             <h4 class="font-bold text-blue-900 mb-2">Use "Years Only"</h4>
             <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">Instead of "Jan 2022 - Mar 2024", just write "2022 - 2024". This hides gaps of up to 11 months effortlessly. This is standard for executive resumes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
             <h4 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-2">Avoid Functional Resumes</h4>
             <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">Recruiters hate "Functional Resumes" (Skills-based, no dates). It screams "I am hiding something." Stick to Reverse Chronological. Address the gap, don't hide the timeline.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">1. Will a gap hurt my salary negotiation?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Only if you let it. If they ask "What are your salary expectations?" and you say "Well, I haven't worked in a year, so I'm flexible...", you lose leverage. Stick to market rates. "I'm looking for roles in the $150k range based on my 10 years of experience."</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">2. What if I was fired for performance?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Never say "I was fired." Say "It wasn't a good culture fit." Or "The role changed and wasn't aligned with my strengths." Then pivot immediately to what you learned.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">3. How long is "too long"?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Anything over 1 year raises eyebrows. If you are approaching the 1-year mark, you MUST start the "Consulting" patch (Section 1). Do pro-bono work if you have to. You need current activity.</p>
