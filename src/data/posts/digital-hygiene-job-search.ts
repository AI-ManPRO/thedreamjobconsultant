      <h3 class="text-red-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The Invisible Reject Pile</h3>
      <p class="text-red-800 mb-0">
        You interview well. Your resume is perfect. But you get a generic rejection email. Why? Because the Hiring Manager found your Reddit account or an old Facebook comment, and decided you were "high risk." They will never tell you this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      In 2026, your "Resume" is just a claim. Google results are the verification.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Before you send a single application, you must perform a "Digital Audit." This isn't just about hiding beer bong photos. It's about ensuring your online persona matches your professional brand.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The "Incognito" Test</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Open an Incognito/Private window. Google your name. Then Google "Your Name + [City]" and "Your Name + [Current Company]."
    </p>

    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">What to look for:</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Page 1 is God:</strong> 95% of people never go to Page 2. You must own Page 1. If Page 1 has something negative, you have a crisis.</li>
            <li><strong>Images Tab:</strong> This is dangerous. Are there party photos from college? Tagged photos from friends? A photo of you protesting? (Even if righteous, companies fear controversy).</li>
            <li><strong>Political Rants:</strong> Companies are terrified of polarization. If you look like an activist (for any side), you are a liability. Scrub it.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <img src="/images/blog/digital-hygiene-job-search-inner-1.png" alt="Digital eraser wiping binary footprints from a glowing floor" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg my-8" />

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. The "Lockdown" Checklist</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      You don't need to delete everything, but you need to lock it down.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-4 mb-8">
        <li><strong>Facebook/Instagram:</strong> Set everything to "Friends Only." Remove tagging permissions (so friends can't tag you in drunk photos without approval). Go through your profile pictures—are they safe?</li>
        <li><strong>X (Twitter):</strong> If you use it for professional networking, scrub it. Use tools like TweetDeleter to auto-delete anything older than 1 year or containing specific keywords (e.g., swear words, political figures). If it's personal, make it private.</li>
        <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> This is the ONLY channel that should be fully public. Ensure your "Activity" (what you like and comment on) is professional. "Liking" a controversial post is visible to recruiters!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Burying the Bodies (SEO Defense)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      You found something bad on Page 1 (e.g., a mugshot, a lawsuit, a bad review). You probably can't delete it (unless it violates a law). So you must bury it.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The solution to bad content is <strong>More Good Content</strong>. Google loves fresh, authoritative content.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">The Displacement Strategy</h4>
        <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Create profiles on high-authority sites. Google ranks these high, pushing the bad stuff to Page 2.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Medium.com:</strong> Write one article related to your profession. Title it with your full name.</li>
            <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> Even if you aren't a coder, create a profile. It ranks high.</li>
            <li><strong>About.me / Carrd:</strong> Create a simple personal landing page.</li>
            <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> Upload a 30-second "Video Resume" or intro. Video ranks nicely in search.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Data Brokers: The Hidden Enemy</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Sites like Whitepages, Spokeo, and MyLife scrape public records and sell your data (home address, traffic tickets, relatives).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>How to remove yourself:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-2 mb-8">
        <li><strong>Manual Way (Free but slow):</strong> Go to each site (there are ~50 major ones), find the "Opt Out" link in the footer, and submit a request. It takes hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Way (Paid):</strong> Use a service like DeleteMe or Optery. They scan these sites and send legal removal requests on your behalf. Highly recommended for executives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. The "Old Resume" Ghost</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Check job boards (Indeed, Monster) where you might have uploaded a resume 5 years ago.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Risk:</strong> A recruiter finds your old resume with a lower title or salary expectations, or outdated skills. It creates confusion. Delete all old versions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">6. Case Study: The "Tweet" that Killed an Offer</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Candidate:</strong> "David," a VP of Comms.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Incident:</strong> During background checks, an analyst found a tweet from 2018 where David made an off-color joke about a competitor's product failing.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Result:</strong> The offer was rescinded. Not because of the joke, but because it showed "lack of judgment" for a Comms role. The company didn't want the PR risk.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Lesson:</strong> The internet never forgets, but you can make it harder for them to remember.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Your digital reputation is your new credit score. You might think it's unfair that companies judge you for your personal life, but they do. Clean up your house before you invite guests in.
    </p>
