      <h3 class="text-emerald-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">Preparation = Confidence</h3>
      <p class="text-emerald-800 mb-0">
        Nervousness comes from the unknown. "What if they ask this? What if my mic fails?" Preparation eliminates variables. When you eliminate variables, you eliminate anxiety.

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Don't spend the night before the interview cramming code. Spend it setting the stage.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Phase 1: Research (The Intel)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>1. Stalk the Interviewer:</strong> Check their LinkedIn. Did they go to your school? Do they love tennis? Find one "Icebreaker" topic.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>2. Read the Annual Report / Blog:</strong> Know their stock price. Know their latest product launch. Mentioning "I saw your Q3 revenue grew 15%" puts you in the top 1% of candidates.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>3. Check Glassdoor:</strong> Look for "Interview Questions." Often, companies recycle the same questions for years.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Phase 2: Logistics (The Stage)</h2>
    
    <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">The Zoom Audit</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-indigo-900 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Light should be IN FRONT of you, not behind. No "Witness Protection Program" silhouettes. Buy a $20 ring light if you need to.</li>
            <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Wear headphones. Laptop mics pick up echo. AirPods are fine, but ensure they are charged.</li>
            <li><strong>Background:</strong> Clean works. A bookshelf works. A messy bed does not work. Use "Blur" if your room is a disaster.</li>
            <li><strong>Eye Contact:</strong> Put a sticky note with a smiley face right next to your camera lens. Look at the note, not the screen. This mimics eye contact.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-4">Disaster Recovery (The Backup Plan)</h4>
        <p class="text-red-800 mb-4">
            Tech fails. It happens. Be ready.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-red-800 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Internet Outage:</strong> Include your phone number in the initial email response. "If we get disconnected, call me here." Have your phone hotspot ready.</li>
            <li><strong>Zoom Update:</strong> Open Zoom 10 mins early. It <em>always</em> wants to update right when the meeting starts.</li>
            <li><strong>Screen Share Fail:</strong> Have your portfolio/slides sent to them via email <em>before</em> the call as a backup. "I just emailed you the deck in case share fails."</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Phase 3: Content (The Script)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>7. Prepare your STAR Stories:</strong> Have 3 stories ready: One for "Leadership" (I led a team), one for "Failure" (I made a mistake and fixed it), one for "Success" (I made money).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>8. Prepare YOUR Questions:</strong> Write down 3 questions to ask them.
      <br><strong>Good:</strong> "What does success look like in this role?"
      <br><strong>Better:</strong> "I saw you are moving into AI products. How does this role support that strategic initiative?"
      <br><strong>Best:</strong> "What is the one thing keeping you up at night regarding the team's goals?"
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Phase 4: Mental Game (The Vibe)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>9. The Power Pose:</strong> It sounds silly, but standing like Superman for 2 minutes reduces cortisol and increases testosterone (Amy Cuddy Science). Do this 5 mins before the call.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>10. Sleep:</strong> Your brain IQ drops 15 points if you are tired. Sleep beats cramming.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Control what you can control. You can't control the questions they ask. You CAN control your lighting, your research, and your sleep. Winning the controllables gives you the confidence to handle the uncontrollables.
