      <h3 class="text-emerald-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">Stop Acting Like an Employee</h3>
      <p class="text-emerald-800 mb-0">
        As an employee, you are paid for <strong>Attendance</strong>. You show up, you get paid. As a consultant, you are paid for <strong>Outcomes</strong>. If you show up and deliver nothing, you get $0. This terror is what paralyzes most new consultants.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      I see VP-level executives quit their jobs to "consult," and 6 months later they are begging for their old job back. Not because they lack skill, but because they lack the "Business Owner" mindset.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The "Permission" Trap</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Employees wait for permission. "Can I launch this campaign? Can I buy this software?"
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Consultants <strong>prescribe</strong>. You are the doctor. You don't ask the patient "Can I prescribe you antibiotics?" You tell them what they need.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      If you ask your client for permission to do your job, they will treat you like a junior employee (and pay you like one). You must lead the engagement. You set the agenda. You set the timeline.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Pricing: Hourly vs. Value</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      The biggest mistake is billing by the hour.
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">Why Hourly Billing Fails</h4>
        <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">If you charge $200/hour, you are punished for being fast. If you solve a $1M problem in 1 hour, you make $200. That is insane.</p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4"><strong>The Fix: Value-Based Pricing.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 italic">"I will fix your supply chain bottleneck. The value to you is $1M/year in savings. My fee is a flat $50,000 project fee."</p>
        <p class="text-sm mt-2 font-bold text-emerald-600">You just made $50,000 for what might take you 10 hours. That is an effective rate of $5,000/hour. This is ethical because the client pays for the Result, not your Suffering.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Building the Sales Funnel</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      As an employee, work lands on your desk. As a consultant, you have to hunt for it. You need to spend <strong>50% of your time marketing and selling</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <strong class="block text-navy-900 mb-2">The Simple Funnel:</strong>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Content (Top of Funnel):</strong> Post case studies on LinkedIn daily. "How I fixed X for Client Y."</li>
            <li><strong>Lead Magnet (Middle of Funnel):</strong> "Download my 5-step Audit Checklist."</li>
            <li><strong>Sales Call (Bottom of Funnel):</strong> A 30-minute "Discovery Call." Do NOT pitch. Diagnose. Ask questions until they admit they have a problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Send a 3-tier proposal (Gold, Silver, Bronze options). This anchors them to a price.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. The Rollercoaster Cash Flow</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Your paycheck is no longer guaranteed on the 1st and 15th. You will have a month where you make $30k, and a month where you make $0.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      <strong>Rule:</strong> You need 6 months of "Runway" (Living Expenses) in the bank before you quit. If you verify your bank account every day out of panic, you will reek of desperation in sales meetings. Clients can smell desperation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. Tax Strategy (Keep Your Money)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you make over $100k/year, forming an S-Corp (in the US) can save you thousands in Self-Employment Tax.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-2 mb-8">
        <li><strong>Write-offs:</strong> Your home office, your laptop, your internet, your business travel—all tax deductible.</li>
        <li><strong>Retirement:</strong> You can open a SEP-IRA and contribute ~20% of your income (up to $60k+), far more than a 401k at a job.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">6. Case Study: The "Accidental" Consultant</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Candidate:</strong> "Mark," a Director of Operations.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Transition:</strong> He was laid off. Instead of applying for jobs, he reached out to 5 former vendors he used to manage.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Pitch:</strong> "I know exactly how your big clients think (because I was one). I can help you close more enterprise deals."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Result:</strong> 3 of the 5 vendors hired him on a retainer advisor basis. He replaced his full-time salary in 6 weeks, working 20 hours a week.
    </p>

    {{AD_2}}
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
     Consulting is the ultimate freedom, but freedom isn't free. The price of freedom is uncertainty. If you can stomach the uncertainty, you will never have to ask for a vacation day again. You just take it.
