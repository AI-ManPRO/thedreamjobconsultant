      "Tell me about yourself." It seems like an icebreaker. It is not. It is the <strong>Executive Summary</strong> of your candidacy.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Psychology tells us that interviewers make a decision in the first 4 minutes. The rest of the hour is just Confirmation Bias. If you ramble for 10 minutes about your childhood, you have lost before you started.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Your answer needs to be a trailer for the movie of your career. Highlights only. Explosions only. Leave them wanting to see the full film.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The Structure: Present, Past, Future</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Keep your answer between 90 seconds and 2 minutes. Use this timeline.
    </p>

    <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
        <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <strong class="text-navy-900 block mb-2 text-lg">1. The Present (The "Headline") - 20 Seconds</strong>
            <p class="text-slate-700">Start with who you are NOW. <br> <em>"Currently, I am a Senior Product Manager at TechCorp, where I lead the Mobile App team. My specialty is turning 'feature factories' into product-led growth engines."</em></p>
        </div>
         <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <strong class="text-navy-900 block mb-2 text-lg">2. The Past (The "Highlights Reel") - 60 Seconds</strong>
            <p class="text-slate-700">Don't list every job. Pick 2-3 "pivot points" that are relevant to THIS job. <br> <em>"Before that, I spent 5 years in Engineering. I realized I loved the 'Why' more than the 'How', which led me to transition into Product. At Startup X, I built the MVP that raised our Series A..."</em></p>
        </div>
         <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
            <strong class="text-navy-900 block mb-2 text-lg">3. The Future (The "Why You") - 30 Seconds</strong>
            <p class="text-slate-700">Connect the dots to this specific interview. <br> <em>"That brings me to today. I've been following [Company]'s move into the Enterprise space, and knowing my background in B2B scaling, I felt this was the perfect next step to apply my skills in [Skill X]."</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Creating a "Theme"</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Random jobs confuse people. "He was a teacher, then a sales rep, then a coder?" It sounds unstable.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      You need a Narrative Thread. A Theme.
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">Example Themes:</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>The Problem Solver:</strong> "Throughout my career, whether in Ops or Sales, my focus has always been fixing broken processes."</li>
            <li><strong>The Communicator:</strong> "My background in teaching gave me the ability to explain complex tech to non-tech users, which I now use as a Customer Success Manager."</li>
            <li><strong>The Builder:</strong> "I am obsessed with 0 to 1. I love the chaos of the early days."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Scripts for Every Situation</h2>
    
    <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-700 mt-6 mb-2">Script A: The Career Pivoter</h4>
    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-slate-200 italic text-slate-600 mb-6">
        "I'm currently a Marketing Manager, but my background is actually in Psychology. <br><br>
        Early in my career, I worked as a counselor. I learned how to really listen to what people need, not just what they say. Five years ago, I realized those same skills applied to understanding consumer behavior. <br><br>
        I moved into Digital Marketing, where I used that psychology background to write copy that doubled our conversion rates. Now, I'm looking to move into User Research (UXR), because it combines my data skills with my core passion for understanding human motivation."
    </div>

    <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-700 mt-6 mb-2">Script B: The Senior Leader</h4>
    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-slate-200 italic text-slate-600 mb-6">
        "I've spent the last 15 years in FinTech, primarily focused on Scaling Operations. <br><br>
        Most recently at [Company], I helped grow the team from 50 to 500. I love the 'messy middle' stage of growth. Before that, I was a consultant at Deloitte, which gave me a rigorous foundation in process optimization. <br><br>
        I'm here today because I see [Company] is hitting that same inflexion point of growth, and I want to bring my playbook for scaling operational rigour without killing the startup culture."

        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">1. Can I memorize a script?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Yes, but don't <em>sound</em> memorized. Have bullet points in your head (The Anchor, The Pivot, The Goal). Practice saying it out loud until it sounds natural. Record yourself.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">2. What if I was laid off?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Mention it briefly in the "Past" section but frame it neutrally. "My role was impacted by a restructuring last month, which actually gave me the clarity to pursue this new direction in..." Don't dwell on it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">3. How is this different for a Screening Call vs Hiring Manager?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600"><strong>Recruiter Screen:</strong> Keep it high-level, focus on keywords and basic fit. <br><strong>Hiring Manager:</strong> Focus on "Why You" and specific problems you solved that are relevant to <em>their</em> team.</p>
