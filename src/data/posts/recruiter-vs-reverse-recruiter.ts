      <h3 class="text-emerald-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The Real Estate Metaphor</h3>
      <p class="text-emerald-800 mb-0">
        Think of buying a house.
        <br>The <strong>Listing Agent</strong> represents the Seller. They want the highest price for the seller.
        <br>The <strong>Buyer's Agent</strong> represents You. They want the best deal for you.
        <br><br>
        In the job market:
        <br>The <strong>Recruiter</strong> is the Listing Agent (Works for the Company).
        <br>The <strong>Reverse Recruiter</strong> is the Buyer's Agent (Works for You).
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      If you are waiting for a Recruiter to "find you a job," you might wait forever. That isn't their job.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The Traditional Recruiter (Headhunter)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Who pays them?</strong> The Company (Employer).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Model:</strong> They get paid a commission (usually 20-25% of your Year 1 Salary) <em>if and only if</em> the company hires you.
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">Pros & Cons for You</h4>
        <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
            <div>
                 <p class="font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">The Good</p>
                 <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1">
                    <li>It's free for you.</li>
                    <li>They have access to "Hidden Jobs" (unlisted roles).</li>
                    <li>They want you to get a high salary (it boosts their commission).</li>
                 </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                 <p class="font-bold text-red-700 mb-2">The Bad</p>
                 <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1">
                    <li>They will ghost you instantly if you aren't a "Perfect Fit."</li>
                    <li>They won't help you fix your resume (waste of their time).</li>
                    <li>They care about filling the role, not your career happiness.</li>
                 </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. The Reverse Recruiter (Your Agent)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Who pays them?</strong> You (The Candidate).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Model:</strong> You pay a monthly fee or upfront package. They act as your "Outsourced Job Search Team."
    </p>

    <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">What They Do (The Heavy Lifting):</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-indigo-900 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Sourcing:</strong> They scan job boards daily and create a curated list of matches.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> They fill out the tedious applications for you (saving you 10+ hours a week).</li>
            <li><strong>Networking:</strong> They find the Hiring Manager's email and ghostwrite the outreach message for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Interview Prep:</strong> They coach you before the call, researching the interviewer's background.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-800 mt-8 mb-4">How to Negotiate with a Headhunter</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Remember, the Headhunter gets paid a % of your salary. So they <em>should</em> want you to get a higher offer, right?
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The Trap:</strong> They want the deal to CLOSE. If asking for $10k more risks the deal falling through, they will pressure you to "Just take the offer, it's a great opportunity."
    </p>
    <p class="bg-slate-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-slate-400 italic">
        <strong>Script:</strong> "I know your commission is tied to my comp, so we are on the same team. I need $150k to sign. Help me get there, and we both win." (Remind them of the incentive).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Who Needs Which?</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Use a Headhunter If:</strong>
      <br>- You are a Senior Executive (Director/VP/C-Suite).
      <br>- You have a very niche, high-demand hard skill (e.g., AI Engineer, Actuary).
      <br>- You <em>don't</em> need a job urgently; you are just passive looking.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Hire a Reverse Recruiter If:</strong>
      <br>- You are busy working full-time and have 0 hours to search.
      <br>- You hate the process (Finding emails, tweaking resumes).
      <br>- You are pivoting careers (Headhunters ignore pivoters; they want safe bets).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. The "Career Coach" Element</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      A Reverse Recruiter is often 50% Admin, 50% Coach.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      They prevent you from applying to "Ghost Jobs." They stop you from sending cringe-worthy emails. They are your emotional support system when rejection happens.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Don't get mad at standard recruiters for ghosting you. They are salespeople with a quota. If you want loyalty, you have to pay for it (Reverse Recruiting). If you want opportunity, you have to build relationships with both.
    </p>
