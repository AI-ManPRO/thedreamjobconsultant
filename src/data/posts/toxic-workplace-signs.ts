      We spend 1/3 of our lives at work. If that environment is poisonous, it poisons everything else: your health, your relationships, your sleep.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      But "Toxic" is thrown around loosely. A strict deadline is not toxic. A rude client is not toxic.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      True toxicity is systemic. It is psychological warfare. It is a culture of fear, blame, and manipulation. Recognizing it is the first step to escaping it.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The Top 5 Red Flags</h2>
    
    <div class="space-y-6 mb-8">
        <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-red-500">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">1. "We are a Family"</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-700"><strong>Translation:</strong> "We expect you to work unpaid overtime, accept abuse, and never complain because 'family' sacrifices for each other." <br> <strong>Reality:</strong> A company is a Team, not a Family. Teams have boundaries. Families are dysfunctional.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-red-500">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">2. The "Moving Goalpost"</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-700">You hit your sales target. They raise it retroactively. You finish the project. They say it's not what they wanted (even though you followed the brief). You can never win.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-red-500">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">3. Gaslighting</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-700">"I never said that." "You are being too sensitive." "You're imagining things." They make you question your own reality and memory.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-red-500">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">4. 24/7 Availability</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-700">Emails at 11 PM. Slack messages on Sunday morning. And if you don't reply in 5 minutes, you are "not dedicated." This destroys your nervous system.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-red-500">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">5. High Turnover</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-700">If everyone on the team has been there less than 6 months, run. People don't leave good jobs in droves.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Survival Mode: The "CYA" File</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you can't quit yet (bills to pay), you must protect yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Start a "Cover Your A**" document.
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> After a verbal meeting where your boss is abusive or gives vague instructions, send an email: "Just to recap our conversation, you asked for X by date Y. Please confirm." Get it in writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Save Evidence:</strong> Forward critical emails to your personal address (check your NDA first, but generally documenting harassment is protected).</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Engage:</strong> Be boring. "Grey Rock" method. Give short, neutral answers. Don't give them emotional fuel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. The Exit Strategy</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Do not rage quit. I repeat: Do not rage quit.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The best revenge is a massive success.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Detecting Toxicity in Interviews</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Don't jump from the frying pan into the fire. Ask these questions to spot a toxic boss <em>before</em> you sign.
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 space-y-3">
        <li>"How does the team handle conflict?" (If they say "We don't have conflict," they are lying).</li>
        <li>"Why is this position open?" (If the last person "couldn't hack it," red flag).</li>
        <li>"What happened to the last person in this role?"</li>
        <li>Watch the interactions. Do people look happy? Or terrified?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">1. Should I put a bad boss on my reference list?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">No. List a colleague, a client, or a skip-level manager who liked you. You actally don't have to list your direct supervisor.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">2. How do I recover from workplace trauma?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Take a break if you can. Therapy helps. Validate that it wasn't your fault. De-program the gaslighting. It takes time to trust a new boss.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">3. Is it worth suing?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Rarely. It drains you emotionally and financially. Unless there was clear illegal discrimination (EEOC), the best move is usually to leave and thrive elsewhere.</p>
