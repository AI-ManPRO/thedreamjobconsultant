    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      "Personal Brand" is a buzzword that makes most professionals cringe. It sounds like "Self-Promotion."
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      But in 2026, your reputation is digital. If someone Googles your name and finds nothing, you are a risk. If they find a rich history of thoughts, articles, and projects, you are an <strong>Asset</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      A strong personal brand means opportunities come to <em>you</em>. Recruiters DM you. Clients email you. You stop chasing work and start attracting it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The 3-Pillar Strategy</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      You cannot be known for everything. "I am a Tech/Marketing/Sales Guru." No, you are confused.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Pick 3 Pillars. These are the only things you talk about publically.
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8 border border-slate-200">
        <strong class="text-navy-900 block mb-2">Example: The "FinTech Product Manager"</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Pillar 1 (Hard Skill):</strong> Mobile Banking UX Design.</li>
            <li><strong>Pillar 2 (Industry Trend):</strong> Cryptocurrency Regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Pillar 3 (Soft Skill):</strong> Leading Remote Teams.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500">When people think of "Crypto UX," they should think of YOU. Narrow your focus to expand your influence.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. The Content Engine (For Busy People)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      "I don't have time to write on LinkedIn." Yes, you do. You just lack a system.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Use the "Document, Don't Create" method.
    </p>
    
    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border">
             <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">The Source Material</h4>
             <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">Did you solve a bug today? Did you have a realization in a meeting? Did you read an interesting article? That is your content.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border">
             <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">The format</h4>
             <p class="text-sm text-slate-700"><strong>The Observation:</strong> "I noticed X happening in the market..."<br><strong>The Insight:</strong> "This matters because..."<br><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> "Next time, try Y."</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Own Your Name (The Website)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you rely on LinkedIn, you are renting land. Algorithms change. Accounts get banned.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Buy <strong>YourName.com</strong>. Put a simple Squarespace or Carrd site up.
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Who you are.</li>
        <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Links to your best work (Case Studies).</li>
        <li><strong>Contact:</strong> A way to email you directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Newsletter:</strong> A way to capture emails (Substack).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500">This is your permanent home on the internet.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Public Speaking (The Accelerator)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Nothing builds authority faster than holding a microphone.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      You don't need to keynote TED. Start small.
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 mb-6 space-y-2 text-slate-600">
        <li><strong>Internal Lunch & Learns:</strong> Teach your team about a new tool. Record it.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Meetups:</strong> "React Developers of Austin." They always need speakers.</li>
        <li><strong>Podcasts:</strong> Be a guest on a small industry podcast. It's easier than you think.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-yellow-200">
        <strong class="text-yellow-900">The "Speaker" Effect:</strong>
        <p class="text-yellow-800 mt-2">Once you have one photo of you speaking on stage, put it as your LinkedIn banner. Your perceived value instantly doubles.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. Networking with Influence</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Don't just network with peers. Network with "Amplifiers."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Find the people in your industry who already have an audience. Engage with their content thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      <strong>The "Top Comment" Strategy:</strong> If a big influencer posts, be the first to leave a high-value comment. Their 100,000 followers will see YOUR comment. If it's smart, they will click your profile. This is "Drafting" off their traffic.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">1. Do I need professional photos?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Yes. It is the highest ROI $200 you will spend. A grainy selfie says "Amateur." A sharp headshot says "Pro."</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">2. What if my employer gets mad?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Frame it as "evangelizing the company." "I'm posting about the great work WE are doing." Smart companies love it when their employees are influencers. It helps them hire.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">3. How do I deal with trolls?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Ignore and block. Never argue in the comments. It lowers your status. Silence is power.</p>
