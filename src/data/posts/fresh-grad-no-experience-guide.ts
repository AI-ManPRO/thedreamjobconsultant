      <h3 class="text-indigo-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The Experience Paradox</h3>
      <p class="text-indigo-800 mb-0">
        You need a job to get experience. You need experience to get a job. This cycle traps thousands of grads every year. The only way out is to <strong>redefine what "Experience" means.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Employers don't pay for "Time Served." They pay for "Problems Solved." If you solved a problem in a dorm room, it counts.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The "Capstone" Is Your First Job</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Did you do a final year project? Did you build an app? Did you analyze a marketing case?
    </p>
    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">Resume Translation:</h4>
        <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded">
                <p class="font-bold text-red-800">Student Mindset</p>
                <p class="text-sm text-red-600">"I took a class on Python and got an A."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded">
                <p class="font-bold text-green-800">Professional Mindset</p>
                <p class="text-sm text-green-700">"Experience: Python Developer (Project Based). Built a data scraper that analyzed 500 Twitter sentiments with 95% accuracy."</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mt-4 italic text-slate-500 text-sm">See the difference? One sounds like homework. The other sounds like work.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Volunteer Work is Real Work</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you managed the social media for your Hiking Club, you are a "Social Media Manager."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't put it under "Volunteering" at the bottom. Put it under "Experience."
      <br><strong>Role:</strong> Head of Marketing, University Hiking Club.
      <br><strong>Result:</strong> Grew membership by 40% via Instagram campaigns.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Building a Portfolio (The Spec Work Strategy)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Can't find a job? Create one.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3 mb-8">
        <li><strong>Designers:</strong> Redesign the Spotify logo and post it on Behance. Explanation: "I felt the UX was cluttered, so I simplified the nav bar."</li>
        <li><strong>Marketers:</strong> Write a 5-page SEO audit for a local bakery and send it to them for free. "I noticed you aren't ranking for 'Gluten Free Donuts'. Here is how to fix it."</li>
        <li><strong>Coders:</strong> Contribute to an Open Source project on GitHub. Or build a simple "To Do" app that uses a modern stack (React/Next.js) and host it live.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
        When an interviewer asks "What have you done?", point to this. "I haven't worked at Google, but I fixed a bug in React that is used by 1 million people." That wins.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Networking (The Cheat Code)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Applying online is hardest for Fresh Grads because the ATS filters for "Years of Experience." The algorithm hates you.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Strategy:</strong> Reach out to Alumni from your school.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-slate-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-slate-400 italic">
        "Hi [Name], I'm a senior at [Uni] majoring in [Major]. I see you graduated in 2018 and are now at [Company]. I'd love to ask 2 questions about how you made that transition. Go [Mascot]!"
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Alumni have a soft spot for students. Use it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-800 mt-8 mb-4">The "Internship" Loophole</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        If you can't get a full-time job, offer to work as an "Intern" for 3 months at a startup.
        <br>Say: "I'll work for minimum wage (or free, if legal/feasible) for 90 days. If I bring value, hire me. If not, we part ways, and I get a resume logo."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Most startups are cash poor but labor hungry. They will take this deal.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      You have more to offer than you think. Stop apologizing for your lack of experience and start showcasing your potential, your projects, and your drive.
