      <h3 class="text-indigo-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The "Inbox" Reality</h3>
      <p class="text-indigo-800 mb-0">
        A CEO receives 200 emails a day. They spend 3 seconds scanning the subject line and the first sentence on their phone preview. If you don't hook them there, you are deleted.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      "I applied online and haven't heard back." This is the mantra of the passive candidate.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The proactive candidate doesn't wait. They find the Hiring Manager's email (it's not that hard) and they pitch them directly. But there is a fine line between being "proactive" and being "annoying."

    <p class="mb-4">
      A bad cold email is about YOU. "I am looking for... I need... I want..."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      A good cold email is about THEM. "I noticed your company is... I solved this problem by..."

            <li><strong>The Subject Line:</strong> Needs to be boring but relevant. "Question about [Company]" or "Idea for [Department]." Avoid "Urgent" or "Resume."</li>
            <li><strong>The Hook:</strong> Prove you know who they are. "Saw you just raised Series B."</li>
            <li><strong>The Value Prop:</strong> One sentence on how you solve their pain.</li>
            <li><strong>The Soft Call to Action (CTA):</strong> "Worth a chat?" Low friction.</li>

            Hi [Name],<br><br>
            I saw [Company] is scaling the marketing team. Usually, at this stage (Series B), the biggest bottleneck is transitioning from "Founder-led sales" to "Inbound Lead Gen."<br><br>
            I faced this exact challenge at [Previous Company]. I built the automation engine that took us from 0 to 500 leads/month in 90 days. I'd love to share the playbook I used—might be useful as you vet candidates.<br><br>

            I mocked up a quick redesign (attached) that reduces the steps from 5 to 3. Based on industry benchmarks, this could lift conversion by ~15%.<br><br>

    <p class="mb-4">
      "But I don't have their email!" That is a lazy excuse in 2026.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 space-y-3 mb-8">
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Use Hunter.io, Apollo.io, or RocketReach. They all have free tiers.</li>
        <li><strong>The Guessing Game:</strong> It's almost always <em>firstname.lastname@company.com</em> or <em>firstinitial.lastname@company.com</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>MailTester:</strong> Use a free MailTester tool to verify if the email bounces before you send it.</li>

    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>50% of replies come on the follow-up.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Executives are busy. They might have seen your email, thought "that's interesting," and then got distracted by a fire drill.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        <strong>The Rule:</strong> Wait 3 business days. Then bumping it.

        "Hi [Name], bubbling this up in case it got buried. Any thoughts?"

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Cold emailing requires a thick skin. You will get ignored. You might get a "No." But you only need one "Yes" to change your career trajectory. Stop waiting for permission. Pick a target and fire.
