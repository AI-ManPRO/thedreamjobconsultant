      <h3 class="text-slate-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The Wisdom Advantage</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-800 space-y-2 mb-0">
          <li><strong>The "Overqualified" Rebuttal:</strong> Scripts to handle the "You'll be bored" objection.</li>
          <li><strong>Resume Facelift:</strong> What to delete (Year of Graduation, AOL emails).</li>
          <li><strong>Tech Stacking:</strong> Proving you aren't a dinosaur with 3 certifications.</li>
          <li><strong>The "Mentor" Angle:</strong> Positioning yourself as a coach to younger teams.</li>
          <li><strong>Contracting:</strong> The backdoor into age-biased companies.</li>
          <li><strong>Wardrobe & Zoom Guide:</strong> Looking polished without trying too hard.</li>
          <li><strong>Modern Tech Glossary:</strong> Terms to drop casually (SaaS, API, Agile).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Let's address the elephant in the room: Ageism is technically illegal, but practically rampant. Recruiters scrutinize graduation dates. Hiring managers worry about "culture fit" (code for: "will they understand our memes?").
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      However, the narrative that "companies only want 25-year-olds" is false. Companies are desperate for people who can <strong>solve problems without holding their hand.</strong> That is your superpower.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      You don't need to hide your age. You need to reframe it. You aren't "Old School"; you are "Battle Tested." You have seen the market crash, the pivots, and the crises. You have the emotional stability that the 25-year-old lacks.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The Resume Facelift (De-Aging Documents)</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Your resume screams your generation before they even read a word. Fix these "tells" immediately.
    </p>

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
        <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-2">The "Boomer" Signals</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Hotmail/AOL/Yahoo Emails:</strong> Get a Gmail address. Period. "john.doe@aol.com" says "I haven't learned a new tech since 1999."</li>
                <li><strong>Double Spacing after periods:</strong> It's a dead giveaway of typing class. Use single spacing.</li>
                <li><strong>"References Available upon Request":</strong> Obsolete filler. Delete it.</li>
                <li><strong>Graduation Dates:</strong> Delete them. "BA, Marketing, University of Texas." No "1992."</li>
                <li><strong>Experience > 15 Years:</strong> Cut off the jobs from the 90s. Summarize them as "Early Career Note." Only list the last 15 years in detail.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-green-900 mb-2">The Modern Signals</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>LinkedIn URL:</strong> Customize it (linkedin.com/in/name).</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Font:</strong> Calibri, Roboto, or Arial. Not Times New Roman.</li>
                <li><strong>Tech Skills Section:</strong> Put this at the TOP. List Slack, Zoom, Jira, CRM. Show you speak the language.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Handling the "Overqualified" Trap</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      When they say "You're overqualified," they mean three things:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 mb-6 space-y-2 text-slate-600">
        <li>You will cost too much.</li>
        <li>You will get bored and leave.</li>
        <li>You will cause trouble for a younger boss.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8 border border-indigo-200">
        <strong class="text-indigo-900 block mb-2">The Rebuttal Script:</strong>
        <p class="italic text-slate-700 mb-4">"I understand why you might think that looking at my title. But at this stage in my career, I'm not looking to climb the ladder or manage a massive team. I've done that."</p>
        <p class="italic text-slate-700">"What motivates me now is <strong>impact</strong>. I want to be hands-on, solving [Specific Problem], and mentoring the younger team members to help them grow. I'm looking for a home, not a stepping stone. I want to do the work, not just manage it."</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. The Tech Fluency Test</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      The biggest fear employers have is that you can't learn new software. You must destroy this bias in the first 5 minutes.
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>On the Video Review:</strong> Have a good webcam, good lighting, and a virtual background. If you struggle to unmute yourself ("Can you hear me?"), you confirm the bias.</li>
        <li><strong>Mention Tools Casually:</strong> "In my last role, we used Asana for project tracking, but I've also used Trello." Drop names of modern tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Certified:</strong> A "Google Data Analytics" or "Salesforce" certification on a resume of a 55-year-old is powerful. It proves adaptability. It proves you are still "learning."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. The "Consultant" Mindset</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Sometimes, the front door is locked. Try the side door.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Companies are terrified of hiring a "senior" full-time employee (high salary, benefits, difficult to fire). They are LOVING "Consultants."
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
       <strong>The Strategy:</strong> Pitch a project phrase. "I can come on for 6 months to help you set up the Accounting System. No strings attached."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
       Once you are in, and they realize you are indispensable and easy to work with, they will often offer you a full-time role. Or, you might realize you make more money as a consultant!
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <strong class="text-yellow-900">Why this works:</strong>
        <p class="text-sm text-yellow-800">It lowers the risk for the hiring manager. They aren't "marrying" you; they are "dating" you. And you have the skills to dazzle them on the date.</p>
    </div>
    
     <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. Wardrobe & Zoom Setup</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">You do not need to dress like a teenager (Hoodie), but do not dress like a banker (Suit & Tie) if the company is casual.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-800 space-y-2 mb-0">
          <li><strong>The "Cool Parent" Look:</strong> A nice button-down shirt (no tie) or a solid color sweater. Glasses often help imply "Intellectual" rather than "Old".</li>
          <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Do not sit with a window behind you (Silhouette effect). Put a lamp in front of your face. It hides wrinkles and makes you look energetic.</li>
          <li><strong>Camera Angle:</strong> Put your laptop on a stack of books. Eye level. Looking DOWN at a camera gives you a double chin and makes you look tired.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Modern Tech Glossary (Reference for Leaders)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Drop these terms to prove you are current.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">1. Should I dye my hair?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Personal choice. But generally, look "polished." If you look tired or unkempt, it reinforces age bias. Energy matters more than grey hair. Be high-energy in the interview. Sit up straight. Smile.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">2. What if the interviewer is 25?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Treat them with immense respect. Do not "parent" them. Do not say "I've been doing this since before you were born." Ask them for THEIR advice on the company culture. Validate their authority. They are scared you will judge them.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 text-lg mb-2">3. How far back should my LinkedIn go?</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-600">LinkedIn makes it harder to hide dates. However, you don't have to list every job. Focus on the last 15-20 years. For older roles, you can just list "Various Sales Roles | 1995-2005" without detail.</p>
