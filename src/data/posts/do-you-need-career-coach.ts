      <h3 class="text-purple-900 font-bold mb-2 mt-0">The Cost of Waiting</h3>
      <p class="text-purple-800 mb-0">
        Let's do the math. If your target salary is $120k/year, that is $10k/month. Every month you stay unemployed because your resume is broken costs you $10,000. Spending $500 on a coach to speed that up by 1 month is a 20x ROI.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">
      Olympic athletes have coaches. CEOs have coaches. Why do you think you can navigate the most complex job market in history alone?
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Sign 1: You Apply, But Get No Calls</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Your marketing material (Resume/LinkedIn) is failing.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> A coach will rewrite your resume for ATS optimization. You can't see your own typos. You need fresh eyes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Sign 2: You Interview, But Get No Offers</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Your sales pitch is failing.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> Mock Interviews. A coach will tell you: "You ramble when you answer the weakness question" or "Your body language looks defensive." Feedback is the breakfast of champions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Sign 3: You Are Paralyzed by Choice</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> "I don't know what I want to do."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> Value Alignment. A coach helps you inventory your skills and map them to market needs. They turn "I guess I could do anything" into "I am targeting Product Ops roles in FinTech."
    </p>

        <img src="/images/blog/do-you-need-career-coach-inner-1.png" alt="Hiker with a Guide pointing the way" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg my-8" />

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Sign 4: You Are Toxic-Role Trapped</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Burnout. You hate your job so much you have no energy to look for a new one. It is a vicious cycle.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> Accountability. A coach sets small, manageable weekly goals (e.g., "Just update your LinkedIn headline this week"). They keep you moving when you want to give up. They act as your "Career Therapist" (professional boundaries apply, of course).
    </p>
    <div class="bg-pink-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-pink-900 mb-4">The Escape Plan</h4>
        <p class="text-pink-800">
            A coach helps you build a confidential exit strategy.
            <br>1. Secure your references before you quit.
            <br>2. Save 3 months of expenses (F-You Money).
            <br>3. Start interviewing while employed (You are more attractive to buyers when you are not "desperate").
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6">Sign 5: You Are Pivoting</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> You want to move from Teacher to Customer Success Manager.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> Translation. A coach knows the jargon of the new industry and helps you reframe your old skills so they sound relevant.
      <br><em>Teacher</em> becomes <em>"Training & Enablement Specialist."</em>
      <br><em>Lesson Planning</em> becomes <em>"Project Management & Content Delivery."</em>

    <p class="mb-6">
      You can learn everything on YouTube for free. But it will take you 6 months of trial and error. A coach shrinks that timeline to 6 weeks. Time is your most expensive asset.
