🔹 **Real Success with High-Salary Reverse Recruitment / Job Search Support** 🔹

Second Case Study of My Recverse Recruitment Services

Name			: Omar.
Location		: Cairo, Egypt.
Role			: Construction Planning Engineer.
Job Location Targeted	: Gulf Countries.
Job Type Targeted	: Onsite/Relocation.

I’m sharing another successful case study to highlight the results of my reverse recruitment service, which helps job seekers find high-paying roles based on their skills, experience, and career path. 

*For a full description of the reverse recruitment services I provide for interested job seekers, please read the featured post on my LinkedIn profile before reading further.

This case study is unique because it involves a **Construction Planning Engineer**. Although my primary focus is on software engineers and app developers, working with Omar allowed me to test the effectiveness of my system on a different industry, proving that it’s adaptable for any professional, even though I primarily work with in-demand tech roles that offer remote work options.

I worked with **Engineer Omar** over the course of one to two months. With three years of experience and his English language level, he received the highest tier of my service package: the **Consulting Program**, which includes a wide range of support and resources. The opportunities for him started rolling in, with the offers steadily increasing afterward. Here’s a look at the roles that became available to him within a month of starting my program:

1. **Cairo** - Constructions Contracts Manager
2. **Dubai** - Constructions Project Planner for a large, multi-national company
3. **Cairo** - Constructions Planning Engineer with a major Egyptian firm
4. **Dubai** - Constructions Planning Engineer, initiated by the company’s COO
5. **Dubai** - Constructions Planning Engineer for a firm with branches in Canada and the UAE, reached out by the CEO
6. **Cairo** - Project Controls Engineer with a company that operates in both Egypt and Germany
7. **Cairo** - Head of Cost Control & Planning for a major real estate developer in Egypt

Within the first 10 days, Omar received three interview invitations and accepted an offer from a top company in Egypt at nearly double his previous salary. The role will allow him to build stronger expertise in the Egyptian market for the COnstruction Industry, preparing him to move to an even larger firm abroad in the future.
