I’m sharing another successful case study to highlight the results of my reverse recruitment service, which helps job seekers find high-paying roles based on their skills, experience, and career path. 

* Before reading further, please read the first featured post on my LinkedIn profile for a full description of the reverse recruitment services I provide for interested job seekers.

This case study is unique because it involves a *Construction Planning Engineer*. Although my primary focus is on software engineers and developers, working with Omar allowed me to test the effectiveness of my system in a different industry, proving that it’s adaptable for any industry or sector.

I worked with Omar for one or two months, and with three years of experience and his English language level, he received the highest tier of my service package: the **Consulting Program**, which includes a wide range of support and resources. The opportunities for him started rolling in, with the offers steadily increasing afterward. Here’s a look at the roles that became available to him within a month of starting my program:

1. **Cairo** - Construction Contracts Manager.
2. **Dubai** - Construction Project Planner for a large, multi-national company.
3. **Cairo** - Construction Planning Engineer with a major Egyptian firm.
4. **Dubai** - Construction Planning Engineer, initiated by the company’s COO.
5. **Dubai** - Construction Planning Engineer for a firm with branches in Canada and the UAE, reached out by the CEO.
6. **Cairo** - Project Controls Engineer with a company that operates in Egypt and Germany.
7. **Cairo** - Head of Cost Control & Planning for a major real estate developer in Egypt.

Within the first 10 days, Omar received three interview invitations and accepted an offer from a top company in Egypt at nearly double his previous salary. The role will allow him to build stronger expertise in the Egyptian market for the Construction Industry, preparing him to move to an even larger firm abroad in the future.

* Screenshots of these opportunities communications are attached with this post to demonstrate the real impact of our services.* 

* For reference, my first reverse recruitment service case study is in a separate post, likely the second featured post on my LinkedIn profile.
